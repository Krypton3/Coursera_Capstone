    "In this assignment, I will be working on a buisness related problem and try to find a solution. Let's think that an entrepreneur wants to start a restaurant buisness in toronto. I am selecting toronto because I am living in Canada currently. As a international student and a asian person, I always try to find a restaurant that produces the food like in my region. Now, lets say that the entrepreneur also from asia and he/she wants me to find him a suitable location in toronto to start his business which is to open a restaurant. My task is to find him/her best suitable location to place the restaurant. I will be using the data science knowledge that I have acquired so far from the Applied data science capstone course such as clustering machine learning technique."
